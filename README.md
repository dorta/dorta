I'm Diego, a full-time Senior Software Engineer at Variscite LTD.

I'm from Brazil, and I'll never leave my country even though I hate most of the politicians. Besides being a bored engineer, I'm married to my best friend, Luana, and she is the only god I'll ever need as I describe myself without the organ of faith.

I'm an overly patient father of four little dogs (Venus, Kim, Bulma, and Chichi) and a beautiful little girl called Helena, which makes me a cuisine chef at least twice a day. Among all these, I'm a guitar player inspired by actual events on movie screens.
