### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Diego, an exceedingly patient and bored engineer.

Hailing from Brazil, I shall never depart from my beloved country, despite my profound distaste for the majority of politicians. As a steadfast atheist and communist, I am committed to my best friend in marriage, who is the only deity I'll ever require. I'm a doting father to four adorable pups (Venus, Kim, Bulma, and Chichi) and a lovely little girl, which transforms me into a culinary maestro at least twice daily. Amidst these roles, I am a smoking guitarist, drawing inspiration from true events portrayed on the silver screen.
